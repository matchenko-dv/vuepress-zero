# VuePress

It **only** takes one **README.md** file to create and deploy a VuePress site.  
 
The simplicity of this high quality documentation system is the beauty of VuePress. 


## One-Click Deploy

Documentation of other free server deployments like GitHub Pages, Gitlab Pages, Gitlab CLI, Google Firebase, Surge, Heroku 
you can find under [vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/deploy](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/deploy.html)

``If you edit the files in Github direct, the changes are automatically done on the server too.``
