# VuePress

It **only** takes one **README.md** file to create and deploy a VuePress site.
The simplicity of this high quality documentation system is the beauty of VuePress.

Itâ€™s also possible to `vuepress eject` and get a fully blown Vue site that compiles in components and works offline.

Generate an [Initial VuePress Site](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/getting-started.html#global-installation)
official documentation or use this `tutorial.`

## Local Developmen

### Step 1

::: warning COMPATIBILITY NOTE
VuePress requires Node.js >= 8 and npm >= 5.2
:::

To check if you have Node.js and npm installed, run this command in your terminal:

| `node -v` | **and** | `npm -v` |

|&nbsp;[Download Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) &nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read the docs for upgrading](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)|  
| [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) | [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |

Optional:

| [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | [ GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Step 2

```bash
# Create the project folder
mkdir myProject && cd myProject  

# Create a README.md file with markdown formatted content
echo # Hello VuePress > README.md

# Install VuePress temporary for this node process only with development server
npx vuepress dev  

# Open in a browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

With this **README.md** file and the installation of the **VuePress** package, you have a `professional layout out of the box` with this features.

- Responsive layout
- Optional Homepage
- Simple out-of-the-box header-based search
- Algolia Search
- Customizable navbar and sidebar
- Auto-generated GitHub link and page edit links

### Result

**README.md** file with one line of markdown content `# VuePress`

gives you this responsive layout `header`, `search box` and `menu icon` out of the box.

Each markdown file is compiled into HTML with **markdown-it** and then processed as the template of a Vue component. This allows you to directly use Vue inside your markdown files and is great when you need to embed dynamic content.

VuePress compiles `README.md` files using **markdown-it**. You can find the markdown-it syntax in this demo
[Markdown-it demo](https://markdown-it.github.io/)

### Additional Features of VuePress are

- Built-in markdown extensions optimized for technical documentation
- Ability to leverage Vue inside markdown files
- Vue-powered custom theme system
- Automatic Service Worker generation
- Google Analytics Integration
- "Last Updated" based on Git
- Multi-language support

### Step 3

#### Built-in markdown extensions optimized for technical documentation

#### Config Reference

#### `markdown.toc`

- Type: `Object`
- Default: `{ includeLevel: [2, 3] }`

Options for [markdown-it-table-of-contents](https://github.com/Oktavilla/markdown-it-table-of-contents).
(Note: prefer `markdown.slugify` if you want to customize header ids.)

All headers with Level 2 (##) and Level 3 (###) will go automatically into TOC (Table of Contents). This can be customized.

```
# Table of Contents

### Tips and Tricks:

If you need the latest npm installed

```bash
npm install npm@latest -g
```

::: tip
_It is currently recommended to use Yarn instead of npm when installing VuePress into an **existing project** that has webpack 3.x as a dependency. Npm fails to generate the correct dependency tree in this case._
:::

You can check, if **Node**, **Yarn** and **Vuepress** is already installed:

```bash
$ node --version  
$ yarn --version  
$ vuepress --version
```

```bash
$ node -v  
v8.11.3
```

If you see a version number on your screen then the software is installed.  
Otherwise you need to download and install it.
